s# A Hello World project for FTC Spring Training

## Let's run HelloWorld.java - is it working!? 

## We need some comments

## Print Hello world! 5 times using for loop

## Let's put our name in a variable and say Hello to ourselves

## Let's ask for our name instead

## If the name provided is "ftc", let's make it uppercase

## Change the for loop into a while loop, and still loop 5 times

## On the fifth "Hello", say "Hello, Robo!" - how many ways can you do this?
