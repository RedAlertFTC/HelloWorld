# A Hello World project for FTC Spring Training

1. Let's run HelloWorld.java - is it working!? 
2. We need some comments
3. Print Hello world! 5 times using for loop
4. Let's put our name in a variable and say Hello to ourselves
5. Let's ask for our name instead
6. If the name given is "Ftc" and not all caps, let's make it uppercase
7. Change the for loop into a while loop, and still loop 5 times
8. On the fifth "Hello", say "Hello, Robo!" - how many ways can you do this?
9. Let's clear out the program to turn it into a calculator
10. Assign variables x and y to numbers, and print out the sum, difference, and product, and quotient
11. Refactor (big word for change) the sum calculator to use a method (big word for class functions)
12. Commit your changes to git
13. Look for all the changes we and others have made to HelloWorld.java
